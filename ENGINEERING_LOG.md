# Engineering Activity Log

This log tracks the implementation, refactoring, and deployment activities performed by the Application Engineer session.

## [2026-06-09] - Odometer Setup UI & Filter Optimization
- **Activity:** Merged `improve-vehicle-odo-setup` branch into master.
- **Improvements:**
    - **Pixel-Aware Gap Welding:** Replaced bounding-box segment welding with an iterative $X/Y$ pixel-scan `nativeConnectSegmentsH` in `NativeImageUtils.cpp`. Reliably bridges sub-$0.5 \times SW$ gaps while preserving critical empty spaces (e.g. the center of a '0').
    - **Forensic Pruning:** Optimized JSON alignment reports by excluding large JPEGs and path data for non-winning vehicles. Reduced log drop rates.
    - **Filter Relaxation:** Relaxed rolling filter horizontal pairing restriction to `1.0 * vSW` to catch misaligned digit halves.
    - **UI/UX:** Consolidated crop adjustment buttons in `ManageVehiclesScreen` and added isotropic corner dragging.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/cpp/NativeImageUtils.cpp`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/experiment/ExperimentAlignmentScreen.kt`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/vehicle/ManageVehiclesScreen.kt`

## [2026-06-08] - Horizontal Wide Filter Precision Fix
- **Activity:** Merged `fix-j-imagefilter` branch into master. Corrected the native Horizontal Wide Filter logic to prevent over-aggressive digit trimming.
- **Improvements:**
    - **Logic Refinement:** Transitioned from aggregate (total row) pixel summation to **contiguous max-run** tracking in `NativeImageUtils.cpp`.
    - **Digit Integrity:** Ensured that valid digits connected to frames (e.g., Set J, image 94) are no longer sliced by the frame-removal filter.
    - **Verification:** Audited all other run-length loops in the native codebase and confirmed they correctly handle contiguity.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/cpp/NativeImageUtils.cpp`

## [2026-06-07] - Kotlin Whitespace & Style Rectification
- **Activity:** Merged `fix-whitespace` branch into master. Performed a repository-wide automated cleanup of Kotlin formatting violations.
- **Improvements:**
    - **Linting Compliance:** Corrected 559 whitespace and style violations across 18 Kotlin files, achieving 0 violations in the `audit_kotlin_whitespace.py` report.
    - **Formatting:** Standardized control keyword spacing (e.g., `if (`), removed trailing whitespace, and collapsed redundant empty lines.
    - **Build Integrity:** Verified build success via `./build_app` and moved the global `works` tag.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/OdometerOcrUtils.kt`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/experiment/ExperimentAlignmentScreen.kt`
    - (16 other Kotlin source files)

## [2026-06-07] - Odometer OCR Tweak & Filtering Integration
- **Activity:** Merged `tweak-odo-ocr` branch into master. Integrated a major overhaul of the odometer extraction pipeline including advanced native filtering and reporting diagnostics.
- **Improvements:**
    - **Native Filtering:** Implemented robust Horizontal and Vertical wide component filters in `NativeImageUtils.cpp` using contiguous run logic to sever noise connections (frame/grid lines) without damaging characters.
    - **OCR Precision:** Added a 4px bounding box expansion in `OdometerOcrUtils.kt` to compensate for CNN stride loss in the Paddle detector, improving character recall.
    - **Forensics:** Added PBM P4 encoding for 1bpp forensic image exports and updated the HTML report to include "Pre-Rolling" stage snapshots for better debugging of the binarization pipeline.
    - **Protocol:** Enforced the "Spec vs. Reference Precedence" mandate in `GEMINI.md`.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/cpp/NativeImageUtils.cpp`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/experiment/ExperimentAlignmentScreen.kt`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/OdometerOcrUtils.kt`
    - `GEMINI.md`

## [2026-05-30] - Restore Paddle Numeric Parity
- **Activity:** Restored odometer numeric recognition accuracy by swapping the recognizer from the degraded custom numeric model (`rec_numeric_mono`) to the official pre-trained V3 model (`rec_v3_mono`) while keeping the constrained argmax CTC decoding logic.
- **Improvements:**
    - **OCR Engine Stabilization:** Restored Paddle Numeric Greedy accuracy to 91.0% (within 2 images of the 92.4% May 24th peak).
    - **Logic Refinement:** Replaced custom model with `sharedRecognizerV3` paired with `ALLOWED_DIGITS` (`1..10`) and `ALLOWED_DIGITS_DECIMAL` (`1..10` + `93`) index sets, ensuring full flexibility to dynamically change allowed characters on a per-call basis.
- **Analysis of Crop Shifts:**
    - Verified that 5 deskew angles, 47 discovery landmarks, 146 alignment calculations, and 100 ML Kit OCR results changed.
    - Traced the shifts back to **32-pixel Aligned Letterboxing** (padding) in `OdometerOcrUtils.kt` which slightly altered the coordinates fed to ML Kit landmark discovery, causing alignment matrices and crop windows to shift by a few pixels.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/NativePaddleEngine.kt`
    - `TODO.md`

## [2026-05-22] - ICRS Coordinate Migration
- **Activity:** Migrated the entire repository from anisotropic normalization to Isotropic Center-Relative Space (ICRS) to solve alignment geometry bugs and support arbitrary aspect ratios.
- **Improvements:**
    - **Architecture:** Implemented ICRS math (Origin at center, short-edge scaling) in `IcrsMath.kt`.
    - **Data Layer:** Executed DB Schema Migration (v6 to v7) adding the `isIcrs` flag. Standardized `VehicleViewModel` for direct ICRS hydration.
    - **Alignment Core:** Refactored `anchorAlign` and `anchorAlignNative` to use a **Unified ICRS Matrix Formulation**, ensuring resolution and aspect-ratio invariance.
    - **ROI Infrastructure:** Standardized `BufferSet.ManagedCrop` to natively consume ICRS coordinates, ensuring 100% geometric parity across rendering paths.
    - **Forensics:** Integrated raw landmark coordinate serialization into the experiment reports for high-fidelity auditing.
- **Major Lesson Learned:**
    - Sequential application of `postScale` and `postTranslate` in Android `Matrix` causes scale-translation coupling. Switched to a unified affine transform via `setValues` to ensure pixel deltas remain absolute regardless of zoom factor.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/IcrsMath.kt`
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/ImageAlignmentUtils.kt`

## [2026-04-14] - v45 Logic Restoration & Scoping
- **Activity:** Restored 7-segment cleanup and 180° rotation recovery logic following a git reset.
- **Improvements:**
    - Centralized mapping in `clean7SegmentDigits` (h->4, L->7, E->3, G->9, etc.).
    - Implemented `refineNumericResult` to isolate cleaning to numeric displays only.
    - **Bug Fix:** Removed 7-segment cleaning from the Landmark Discovery phase to ensure raw text is used for vehicle identification anchors.
    - Updated odometer parsing to support 4–7 digits.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/OdometerOcrUtils.kt`

## [2026-04-14] - Alignment & Identity Refactoring
- **Activity:** Refactored the experiment harness into a dynamic, registry-based architecture.
- **Improvements:**
    - Created `AlignmentEngine` and `IdentityEngine` interfaces.
    - Implemented `AlignmentRegistry` and `IdentityRegistry` for dynamic algorithm execution.
    - Generalized reporting metadata to support an arbitrary number of engines.
    - **Harness Timing:** Implemented centralized execution timers in `ExperimentAlignmentScreen` to fix 0ms reporting bugs.
    - **Independent Execution:** Decoupled identity algorithms (Feature, Arg, Embedding, Consensus, Tiered, Veto) to run independently for research comparison.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/AlignmentEngine.kt`

- **Improvements:**
    - **File Access:** Implemented `copyAssetToInternal` to avoid "compressed asset" TFLite errors.
    - **Graceful Failure:** Added `try/catch` to interpreter calls to prevent mismatched models from crashing the app.
    - **High-Res Support:** Overwrote 1x1 placeholders with 1280px detection and 640px/80-step/97-class recognition models.
    - **Normalization:** Standardized grayscale normalization in `TfLiteOcrEngine`.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `.gitignore`
    - `app/src/main/assets/tflite/paddle/*`
