# Engineering Activity Log

This log tracks the implementation, refactoring, and deployment activities performed by the Application Engineer session.

## [2026-04-14] - v45 Logic Restoration & Scoping
- **Activity:** Restored 7-segment cleanup and 180° rotation recovery logic following a git reset.
- **Improvements:**
    - Centralized mapping in `clean7SegmentDigits` (h->4, L->7, E->3, G->9, etc.).
    - Implemented `refineNumericResult` to isolate cleaning to numeric displays only.
    - **Bug Fix:** Removed 7-segment cleaning from the Landmark Discovery phase to ensure raw text is used for vehicle identification anchors.
    - Updated odometer parsing to support 4–7 digits.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `app/src/main/java/com/davidlang/vehicleexpensesautomated/ui/util/OdometerOcrUtils.kt`

## [Legacy Completion Migrated from TODO.md]
- [b860046] Fix: Correct HTML report file size rotation logic to accurately count bytes
- [2f1a582] Deep Trace Phase 2d: Finalize report to include missing global discovery images, method scores/times, and tier reached
- [9a07669] Deep Trace Phase 2c: Implement 5-step OCR trace (Raw, Gray, Bile, CLAHE, OTSU) across 3 engines with timings
