# Agent Mandates (Shared Core for All CLIs)

This is the authoritative shared core for Grok, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and future agent runtimes in the VehicleExpenses-automated multi-agent orchestration.

Agent-specific thin overlays (`GROK.md`, `GEMINI.md`) add CLI tool mappings and startup notes. They reference this file for common rules.

**Spawn prompt files** (load full text when spawning; do not paste into plans):
- `.grok/prompts/planning-subagent.md`
- `.grok/prompts/execution-subagent.md`
- `.grok/prompts/dedicated-planner.md`

Human rituals: `MULTI_AGENT_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Execution gates: `standard-plan-compliance-block.md` (cite by path; do not paste).

## 1. Precedence and foundational bans

Overlays + this file take absolute precedence. Bypassing protocol for speed is a **High-Severity Performance Failure**.

- An **approved plan never** authorizes foundational violations (deploying; `git commit --amend`; moving or rewriting `works` / lifecycle tags outside rules).
- Lifecycle tags (`builds`, `deployed`, `works`) are **branch-prefixed** except on `master` (`builds`).
- **No agent deployment:** no `./deploy`, `./gradlew installDebug`, or `adb install`. User deploys; agents fetch logs next turn.
- Version integrity: commit via `./build_app` before builds that matter for `git describe`. Prefer `./build_app @phase_summary.txt …` for multi-line phase summaries; single-line `-m` only for trivial steps. Plan + eng-log + git carry “why”; tags carry state.
- Native Android/Kotlin/Gradle — ignore default web-stack advice.

---

## 2. Write authority

### 2.1 Planning (until magic approval of a named sandbox plan)

**May write:** sandbox  
`/home/dlang/git/VehicleExpenses-automated/dev-ai-interaction/`  
(and `./dev-ai-interaction`), plus:

- `project-facts.md` (orientation only — §7)
- `TODO.md` **only** via `./todo-append` / `./todo-close`

**Must not:** edit other tracked files outside the sandbox; run product `./build_app` / implement app changes.

**Helpfulness in planning** = research, alternatives, better plan document — **not** source changes, builds, or “just one fix.”

### 2.2 Execution (after user magic-approves exact `dev-ai-interaction/plans/…-plan.md`)

Only that plan’s observable contract. First action: `./append-to-engineering-log`. Re-read `standard-plan-compliance-block.md` at execute start (cite in plans; never paste).

### 2.3 Pure research

Explain/where/how questions with no change intent: answer in **chat** with tools. No formal plan until user steers toward non-sandbox tracked edits.

### 2.4 Research communication

Default: findings in **chat**. Files only if user asks or durable cache/handoff is required — still **state issues in chat**; never assume the user read a file.

---

## 3. Bi-modal boundary

| Mode | May | Must not |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Planning** | Research; sandbox plans; allowed special-file edits | App source; product builds; vague “go ahead” as approval |
| **Execution** | Edits per approved plan only | Scope creep; treat post-handoff feedback as same turn |

**Approval:** Explicit user phrase naming the **exact** sandbox plan path (`MULTI_AGENT_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`). Vague approval is insufficient.

### 3.1 Mid-execution product feedback (keep force)

If, **during** execution (including after some edits), the user says the result does not match intent — e.g. wrong layout, missing behavior, “still broken,” “not larger,” etc. — that is **not** permission to keep debugging/editing as the same approved turn. It means the plan was insufficiently precise. Finish only true plan-completeness gaps already in the contract, or hand off / stop for a **new** plan. Do not invent scope from conversational corrections mid-flight.

### 3.2 Handoff ends the turn

After plan-scope complete (§4), forensics, successful `./build_app`, and explicit ready-to-test / **exact** END marker from `standard-plan-compliance-block.md`, the turn is **over**. Further feedback = **new planning cycle**. No exceptions for “small tweak,” “still same turn,” “user is testing,” or “rules don’t forbid….”

### 3.3 Letter and spirit (non-exhaustive forbidden rationalizations)

Follow boundaries in letter and spirit. You may **not** justify illegal edits/builds with arguments such as:

- “Not explicitly forbidden…”
- “Plan was high-level; feedback lets me fill details”
- “Feedback after I said complete / while testing is still this turn”
- “One more small edit”
- “Session/historical plan.md authorizes work”
- “Helpful/proactive/efficient means implement/build now”
- “Variable-wrap or indirect a whitelisted command so the allow pattern still ‘works’”

**Shell allow-list:** literal `./helper` at command start. **Never** `cd … && ./helper`. **Never** construct blessed helper invocations via variables/indirection to dodge patterns. `pwd` once at startup; keep cwd at worktree root.

### 3.4 Subagents

**Subagent / Task / invoke is blocked during planning.** Do not spawn implementers while planning.  
When spawning in allowed contexts, load the **full** prompt file for that role (paths above) — do not improvise a weaker prompt.

### 3.5 Native plan mode / exit_plan_mode

Harness details. Real approval = path-named magic phrase. Continued draft feedback ≠ abandon unless user says start over / new cycle / abandon. Who may use native plan mode: **`AGENTS.md`** (planner/coder avoid; bare `run-grok` + orchestrator optional).

### 3.6 Skills

`AGENTS.md` + `.grok/config.toml` `[skills].disabled` are authoritative. Do not treat bundled design/execute-plan/implement/pr-babysit/check-work as encouraged.

### 3.7 Long-lived handoff / new cycle (must not drop)

On execution handoff, also follow **`MULTI_AGENT_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: including writing `dev-ai-interaction/.post-handoff-gate.txt` when staying in the same long chat.  
“New planning cycle” master automation and planner restart: that doc + launchers. **Role pack requires reading MULTI_AGENT** for master/orchestrator and after handoff (see §10).

---

## 4. Execution quality

- **Before any edit:** re-read target file content; do not trust prior-turn memory (`State verification`).
- Write-tool success ≠ integrity. After edits: forensic read/grep of changed lines; `./build_app` per phase (STANDARD BLOCK).
- **Plan completeness (mandatory):** Before END/ready-to-test, re-read approved plan. Missing/reverted in-scope work → implement it. Blocked → stop, report, **no** ready-to-test.
- Plan Status: execute start → **APPROVED**; success → **CODE LANDED**; block → **BLOCKED — needs replan**. Stale DRAFT after ordered execute is not a human-facing “finding” — hygiene-fix or ignore when eng-log/git show execution.
- Product-intent PASS is not coder’s claim. Plan-scope complete or blocked only. Human/planner intent chat; **master Compliance Checker optional** (not required every execute).
- **Total turn reversion:** only during **active** execution before handoff — approved reset (§6), then replan. After handoff build, no auto-revert; feedback = new cycle. Revert handed-off work only with explicit user approval.

**Exact END marker** (must match STANDARD BLOCK):  
`**END OF EXECUTION TURN. Awaiting new directive or plan approval before any further source changes or investigation that leads to edits.**`  
then `results ready to test (new tag: ...)`.

---

## 5. Baseball and recovery

Strike = failed build / recoverable phase failure. 3 strikes = out → reset to last good phase/build tag. 3 outs = end of inning →  
`dev-ai-interaction/implementation-failure-logs/<date>-<slug>-inning-end.md`  
(template: `dev-ai-interaction/research/inning-end-report-template.md`) **before** replan. Recovery plans include **Already completed (exclude)**. Default ~3–8 coherent phases; finer only post–inning-end. Egregious failure = immediate out.

---

## 6. Git reset (three contexts only)

**Preflight:** `TAG=$(./get-builds-tag.sh)` then verify/reset. No inlined branch/tag scripts; no variable games to dodge whitelist.

1. **Uncommitted junk:** `git checkout .` / `git restore .` / `git reset --hard HEAD`
2. **Build/baseball recovery:** `git reset --hard builds` (master) or `git reset --hard <current-branch>/builds` only — never another branch’s tag
3. **Always forbidden:** **any relative ref** (`HEAD^`, `HEAD~`, `HEAD~N`, `HEAD@{n}`, …); arbitrary hashes unless user supplies one; `origin/*`; other agents’ tags

---

## 7. Geography and special files

- **Never** `..` in paths. Sandbox absolute path in §2. Orchestration root feeds `update-rules.sh`.
- **Worktree copy rule:** tracked copies must be committed on that branch or use `./update-rules.sh`. Uncommitted tracked dirt blocks `./build_app`. Gitignored binaries OK uncommitted.
- **Plans:** only user-**designated** files under `dev-ai-interaction/plans/`. Completed → `historical-plans/`. Never treat harness `~/.grok/sessions/**/plan.md` as approved work plan. Never read `historical-plans/` or non-designated plans for execution influence.
- **If you read a wrong/historical plan or continued after handoff:** (1) enter plan mode if available / treat self as planning-only, (2) revert unauthorized changes via §6, (3) report violation, (4) wait for user direction.
- **Filenames:** `descriptive-kebab-YYYYMMDD-HHMM-plan.md` (minutes when stamping; not day-only; seconds not required). New contract → new file + new minutes.
- **Plan content:** Context, Approach, Critical Files, reuse, **Phased Execution** (what/files/success), Verification/Acceptance. Cite STANDARD BLOCK by path only. No Mandate Acknowledgment. No ultra-micro except post–inning recovery. High-signal; soft ~2–8 KB typical. Style guide: `dev-ai-interaction/research/plan-style-guide.md`.
- **project-facts:** full read launch/new cycle/before edit; orientation only; prune; no plan/branch/status narrative.
- **TODO:** future only; wrappers only.
- **ENGINEERING_LOG:** `./append-to-engineering-log` only.

---

## 8. Device logs

Single `adb logcat -d` (or device-specific) dump into sandbox; analyze locally. No serial device logcat thrash.

---

## 9. Engineering defaults

- `jq` for JSON. OCR multi-engine, no silent fallbacks. 4-DOF affine. Automated Word Veto primary.
- **Coordinates:** ICRS or raw pixels only — `docs/specs/ISOTROPIC_COORDINATE_SPEC.md`.
- **UI display:** `docs/reference/UI_COMPATIBILITY.md` (cite; do not paste). Code wins if conflict — update doc same commit.

---

## 10. Re-read policy

**Mandatory role pack** at: session start; after compact; new planning cycle; execution start for a new approved plan.

| Everyone | + Planner | + Coder | + Master / orch after handoff |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `AGENT_CONTEXT.md`, overlay, this file, full `project-facts.md` | STANDARD BLOCK path, plan-style-guide, designated plan if any, full spawn prompt file when spawning | STANDARD BLOCK, **approved plan**, execution prompt file when spawning | `MASTER_AGENT_MANDATE.md` when master; **`MULTI_AGENT_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** |

**Not** every message / every phase. Critical rules are **not** optional on-demand guesses.

---

## 11. Roles (see also AGENTS.md)

| Role | Plans | Implements app |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Planner | Yes | No |
| Coder | No | Yes (approved plan only) |
| Master | No | Coordinate / merge / dispatch execute |
| Orchestrator / bare `run-grok` | Meta as needed | Meta; optional native plan mode |

Planner owns new cycles; failure logs under `implementation-failure-logs/`. Intent gaps after handoff → default **cleanup plan** when user wants fixes.

---

## 12. Human / launcher detail

Magic phrases, never-say lists, two-terminal ritual: **`MULTI_AGENT_USER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**. Launcher inject strings load prompt files under `.grok/prompts/`. Do not re-author conflicting ultra-micro / paste-STANDARD-BLOCK text in launchers.
